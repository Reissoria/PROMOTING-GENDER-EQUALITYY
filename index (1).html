    <p> WAYANG KULIT STORYBOARD</p>
    <p> Once upon a time, in the mystical world of Javanese wayang kulit, there was a great warrior named Bima. Tall, strong, and fierce, Bima was one of the Pandava brothers, known for his unmatched bravery and strength. His hands, shaped like claws, symbolized his readiness for battle, while his bold black complexion reflected the depth of his courage. His very presence demanded respect, his booming voice echoing with the power of a thousand held storms.</p>
    <p>But the land of Hastinapura was no longer a place of peace. The wicked king, Duryodhana, had seized control, driving the Pandavas into exile. The whispers of injustice scattered like wildfire, fuming a flame of righteous fury in the hearts of the people.</p>
    <p>Bima, fueled by the injustice, vowed to reclaim his rightful place. He gathered his brothers, Arjuna, the skilled archer, Yudhishthira, the righteous leader, Nakula and Sahadeva, the twins known for their wit and strength. Together, they embarked on a journey to restore balance to the land. They sought the guidance of their wise uncle, Krishna, who became their trusted advisor and guider. Along their path, they tested their skills, and faced tough challenges, each challenge tested their strengths and abilities.</p>
    <p>Bima and his brothers—Arjuna, Yudhishthira, Nakula, and Sahadeva—set out to reclaim their kingdom from the wicked King Duryodhana. Along the way, they face challenges like bandits and magical creatures. Bima uses his strength, while Arjuna shows off his archery skills and Yudhishthira offers wise advice. They gather allies who share their goal.</p>
    <p>Duryodhana learns about their journey and seeks help from the warriors of Bhishma, Drona, Karna, and his uncle Shakuni to stop them. The brothers had already known that they must prepare for a big fight.</p>
    <p>The brothers reach Duryodhana’s stronghold, and Bima confronts Karna in a fierce battle. Just when Bima is about to defeat Karna, he chooses to show mercy and urges Karna to join them instead of fighting for Duryodhana. This act makes Karna reconsider his loyalty.</p>
    <p>Karna decides to join the Pandavas, and together they face Duryodhana and his forces. The people of Hastinapura, inspired by the brothers, rise up against Duryodhana’s absolute power. The battle is fierce, but the Pandavas, now united with Karna, push back Duryodhana's forces.</p>
    <p>Bima challenges Duryodhana to a duel and defeats him. With Duryodhana defeated, the Pandavas reclaim their thrones. They promise to rule with justice and compassion. As they look out over their kingdom, they celebrate their victory and the bond they share as brothers, knowing they’ve restored peace to Hastinapura.</p>

      <h2>Addressing Gender-Based Violence</h2>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Promoting gender equality means ensuring women have equal rights and opportunities by changing laws, improving access to education and healthcare, and supporting women in the workforce. This includes providing financial help for girls to go to school, making schools safe, and offering job training and fair pay. By also raising awareness about gender-based violence and supporting flexible work options, we create a world where everyone, regardless of gender, can succeed equally.</p>
